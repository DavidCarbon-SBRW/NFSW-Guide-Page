# Welcome!

## **Welcome to the NFS World Wiki**

_Why recreate an already existing wiki?_

Simple. Updating Content, the original wiki is now in an archived state and no new content will be added, even though new content is being added in game thanks so the Soapbox Race World Community. 

_So is this a mirror of the NFS World wiki?_

Only the core information is being imported to have information ready, but new content will be added which will not appear in the old NFS World Wiki.

Can I contribute or correct a piece of information?

Yes! The format is based on [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/). So if you know how to use Markdown, then you're good to go.

_When will the new Wiki be completed?_

Estimated Completion date: **Winter 2020**
