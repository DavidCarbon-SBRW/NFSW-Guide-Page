## Getting Super Powers

These engines are all about delivering the middle of the road power output. Think of this as a Ram Air Intake upgrade, which increases engine power in the lower-mid range. It's usually muscle cars such as a Dodge Viper SRT10 or its full-size relative, the Dodge Charger SRT8, that benefit from this engine, but it will also work for exotic cars like the Ford GT and the SLR McLaren.
